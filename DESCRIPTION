Description: It is a computer tool to conduct linear mediation analysis for complex surveys using multi-stage sampling and Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR). Specifically, the mediation analysis method using balanced repeated replications was proposed by Mai, Ha, and Soulakova (2019) <DOI:10.1080/10705511.2018.1559065>. The current version can only handle continuous mediators and outcomes. The development of 'MedSurvey' was sponsored by American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC). However, the contents of MedSurvey do not necessarily represent the policy of the ALSAC.
